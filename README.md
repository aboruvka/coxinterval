# coxinterval
## An R package for Cox-type models with interval-censored data

To install, download the source and run from the command line
```
R CMD build coxinterval
R CMD check coxinterval_<version>.tar.gz
R CMD INSTALL coxinterval_<version>.tar.gz
```
where `coxinterval_<version>.tar.gz` is the tarball generated by `R CMD build`. Instead of `R CMD INSTALL`, `conxinterval` can be loaded and unloaded in an R session with
```
library(coxinterval, lib.loc = "coxinterval.Rcheck")
detach(package:coxinterval, unload = TRUE)
```
respectively, where `coxinterval.Rcheck` is the library generated by `R CMD check`.

`coxinterval` requires C routines from [IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio](https://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/iwm/web/reg/signup.do?source=scholars) version 12.5+ and, with Windows, 32 bit. The package's `Makevars` files finds default installations of CPLEX on Unix-alike, Mac OS X and Windows systems. A custom installation directory can be specified in DOS/POSIX format with the `CPLEXHOME` or `CPLEXDIR` environment variables. One of these must be defined for a system with multiple CPLEX installations. CPLEX provides various library formats. By default `coxinterval` uses the first one returned by `ls`. To override this, provide the DOS/POSIX path to the desired library in the `CPLEXLIBDIR` environment variable.

Installation of `coxinterval` with 32-bit CPLEX and 32-bit R on a 64-bit Windows system can be achieved by replacing the last two `R` commands with
```
R --arch=i386 CMD check --no-multiarch coxinterval_<version>.tar.gz
R --arch=i386 CMD INSTALL --no-multiarch coxinterval_<version>.tar.gz
```
